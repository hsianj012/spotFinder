<ol>
<li>Nothing has really changed in terms of Milestone 1 questions

<li>Features: 
<ul>
<li> [main feature] being able to filter parking options on map - works but has some bugs when logging in/out
<li>search for location and set as center of map - completed
<li>include info windows when you click on a map marker - working but I need to clean up the info displayed
</ul>
<li>Other features from milestone 1:<br>
Print list of selected/viewable markers - haven't started on this at all

<li>Currently no other features.

<li>Back-end: mongodb (via Meteor)

<li>Front-end: jQuery and Handlebars (via Meteor)

<li>Browser: Chrome

<li>Difficulties: I'm haveing trouble finding enough data on each parking option. I've been able to find a several databases of parking garage locations, but haven't been as lucky with free/metered parking. I think the lack data makes the site unbalanced.
