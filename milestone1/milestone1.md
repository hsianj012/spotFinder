<h3>Milestone 1 - Idea, UI/UX, and MVP Features</h3>
<b>User Research</b>
1.    Problem: finding a parking spot <br>
Solution: searchable map w/ potential parking spots highlighted on map
2.	Feature: being able to filter spots by features (free, metered, garage, etc.)
3.	Target Demographic: infrequent driver/commuter not familiar with the parking situation/availability in the city. 
4.	<u>Use Case:</u><br>
User - has an evening appointment at the student center <br>
User - drives to campus, needs place to park<br>
Website - displays map of campus with all possible parking areas<br>
User - has money but no quarters<br>
User - filters parking areas to exclude metered-parking spots<br>
Website - displays parking areas that are free or pay-to-park (excludes meters)<br> 
User - sees pay-to-park location is closest to meeting location<br>
User - parks in pay-to-park garage.<br>

<b>Site Design</b>

designs are in folder

<b>Minimal Viable Product</b>

1. Main feature: being able to filter parking options by pay-type (free, metered, pay-to-pay). Fairly critical, but could display spots without filter capability.
2.	features to leave out:
    - search for location and set as center of map
    - print list of desired parking spots
    
    none of these features are critical to the website functioning
3. There will definitely be limited datasets, probably limited to the Cambridge/MIT area and whatever info that is readily available.

<b>Additional Questions</b>
1.	Judy Hsiang (jhsiang@mit.edu)<br>
MIT Undergraduate (Senior in 2 OE)<br>
Taking for credit
2.	Urban Transportation
3.	Server-side: meteor
4.  My main risk is using a Google API and an experimental API feature. 
5.	I plan to compete in the Rookie division
